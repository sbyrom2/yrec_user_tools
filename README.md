# yrec_user_tools
Tools and guidelines for using the Yale Rotating Evolution Code

This is not part of the offical YREC release, but it may be a useful resource.

This folder contains several tools that may be useful when working with YREC.

`read_output_files.py` contains functions that read the .last, .track, and .store output files from a given YREC run.

The modelgrid_tools subfolder includes guidelines and tools to create a grid of models in YREC. See the readme.md file for more details. 

The YREC Isochrones Guide jupyter notebook walks the user through the process for making isochrones from a YREC grid using `kiauhoku` (Claytor et al. 2020). The notebook contains a tutorial for making isochrones with a pre-made sample grid and set of EEPs (equivalent evolutionary phases) and a tutorial on formatting and creating isochrones from a custom YREC-made grid.
