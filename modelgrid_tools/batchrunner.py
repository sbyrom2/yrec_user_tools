'''
A script to run a grid of yrec models

There are 2 versions within this file.

Version 1 assumes that you have not already created the grid.
To use it, change the masses and FeHs arrays
and modify the parameters of make_MFeHgrid to match your file structure.
Then run this file from the command line.

Version 2
If you've already created the grid (or some other method),
comment out Version 1 and uncomment Version 2.
path_to_nmlfiles is the directory where your grid's nml files
are stored (you should not have other grids in this directory).
Change this and run from the command line.
